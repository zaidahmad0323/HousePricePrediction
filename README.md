# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App

This is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts house prices based on user input such as location, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and area (in square feet). The app uses a trained ML model and is built with Flask on the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the frontend.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predict house prices in real-time
- Location, BHK, bathroom, and area-based predictions
- Trained on real housing data
- Used 3 models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regressor
- Used `cross_val_score` for model evaluation
- Used `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning
- Simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 🧠 Machine Learning

### ✅ Models Used:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**

### 📊 Evaluation Methods:
- **Cross-validation** with `cross_val_score`
- **Hyperparameter tuning** with `GridSearchCV`

All models were tested and the best one was selected based on accuracy and performance.
